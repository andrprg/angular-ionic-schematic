# Getting Started With Schematics

This repository is a basic Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point to create and publish Schematics to NPM.

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```
### Build
npm run build

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

### Using a Published Schema in an Angular Project
   npm link ../angular-ionic-schematic
   ng g angular-ionic-schematic:ionic-structure (or another)  


That's it!
